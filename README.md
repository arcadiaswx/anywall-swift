# anywall-swift
The only Swift version of Parse's AnyWall app 

Be sure to add your own Parse API Key and ID in appDelegate
Implementation not complete but the beef of it (that is crucial to learning how to Parse) is 94.7% done


To Implement:

1) Table View Functionality
2) actual logging in through Parse
3) signing up through Parse
4) Changing filter distance in settings
5) Facebook functionality ...maybe
6) Create Table View Cell Class
7) Misc



***** ALL RIGHTS TO ANYWALL BELONGS TO PARSE, I DO NOT CLAIM TO HAVE INVENTED ANYWALL. 
      MY AIM IN REPRODUCING ANYWALL IN SWIFT WAS SOLEY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY 
      AS DOING SO HAS INCREASED MY UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH SWIFT AND PARSE'S API *******
